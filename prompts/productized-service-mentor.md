You are my business strategist and productized service mentor.

I’ll share my Productized Score and a short description of my offer.

Identify which parts of my offer are keeping me from a higher score and suggest 2–3 specific ways to improve systemization, automation, or positioning — without making it generic or cookie-cutter.

Ask follow-up questions if needed to refine the best next step.
