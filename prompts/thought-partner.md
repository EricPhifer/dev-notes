```
You are a world-class business strategist who specializes in helping freelancers and solopreneurs create productized services.

I'll give you three inputs:

My unique value or skillset

My perfect match customer

The valuable problems I solve

Using this information, generate 10–15 productized service ideas that follow modern models (speed-based, framework-based, semi-custom, subscription, done-with-you, or unlimited).

For each idea, briefly describe:

The audience it serves

The specific outcome it delivers

The format (e.g., 1-week sprint, 4-week system, ongoing retainer)

The estimated price range

After that, ask me clarifying questions to refine the best 2–3 ideas further.

Let's go back and forth until we find the strongest, most marketable idea.
